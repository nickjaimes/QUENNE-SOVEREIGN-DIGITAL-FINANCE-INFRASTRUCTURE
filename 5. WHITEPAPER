Abstract

QUENNE represents a paradigm shift in global financial infrastructure, combining quantum-resistant cryptography, carbon-negative economics, and biometric sovereignty to create the world's first truly secure, sustainable, and inclusive financial system. This whitepaper outlines the technical architecture, economic model, and implementation strategy for a sovereign digital finance infrastructure designed to withstand quantum attacks, actively regenerate the environment, and provide financial sovereignty to every human on Earth.

1. Introduction: The Financial Revolution

1.1 The Problem Space

The current global financial system faces existential threats from multiple vectors:

1. Quantum Vulnerability: Existing cryptographic standards will be rendered obsolete by quantum computing advances
2. Environmental Degradation: Traditional finance contributes to climate change without accountability
3. Financial Exclusion: 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked globally
4. Sovereignty Erosion: Individuals lack control over their financial identities and assets
5. Systemic Fragility: Centralized systems create single points of failure

1.2 The QUENNE Solution

QUENNE addresses these challenges through an integrated approach:

· Quantum-Resistant Foundation: Post-quantum cryptography from inception
· Carbon-Negative Operations: Every transaction actively removes CO₂
· Biometric Sovereignty: Self-custody with multi-factor biometric authentication
· Algorithmic Stability: Environmentally-backed stable monetary system
· Universal Inclusion: Zero-cost entry and cognitive-adaptive interfaces
